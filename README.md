# Predicting Housing Prices Using AI

This code presents the prediction of housing prices using artificial intelligence on a housing dataset. The goal is to explore the best machine learning models that can accurately estimate house values. This prediction will be based on various features such as location, number of rooms, and proximity to the ocean. This problem is important to solve because valid predictions of housing prices can assist homebuyers, sellers, real estate agencies, and other groups in making informed decisions regarding housing affordability such as purchasing or selling a home. Three machine learning models were utilized for this project, and all presented informative findings. The first model was linear regression, and this showcased a limited ability to explain the variability in housing prices, as it performed from poorly to decently. The second model was random forest, and this demonstrated a much higher predictive accuracy. The third and last model was decision tree, and this performed better than linear regression but lower than random forest based on its parameters. The implications of these findings are that random forest is the most effective model for this dataset, suggesting that complex, non-linear relationships exist between the features and the target variable. On the other hand, linear regression, while interpretable, struggles with the datasetâ€™s non-linear nature, indicating that simple models may not suffice for complex real-world data. Finally, decision trees, though interpretable and faster, require careful tuning to maintain its accuracy. These insights could guide stakeholders to prioritize robust ensemble methods like random forest for accurate housing price predictions.
